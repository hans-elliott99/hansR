Notes on package:

- Required packages for development:
  - library(devtools) for creating package elements
  - library(roxygen2) for package documentation


- process:
  - create a new function by adding a new .R file to R/ directory
  - can have multiple functions per .R file, but good idea to group them based on purpose
  - after writing fn, add documentation with roxygen2, and include @export to
    indicate this function to be “exposed” to users to use
  - add any external package dependencies to DESCRIPTION. Including the version is only
    necessary if your function relies on a specific version of the package
  - after done writing fn, run devtools::document(). this will generate the manual (.Rd)
    file in the man/ directory

This package got started thanks to the tutorial located at link: https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html

- also includes: encoding data into the package (in binary or raw form), making vignettes, installing the package, distributing the package via github
